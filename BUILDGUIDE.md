The steps to build a grandiceps :
* Solder the underglow LEDs and capacitors if you are using underglow.
* Solder in the diodes. I place them on the bottom of the board if using chocs.
* Solder a 10k resistor on one half  ( doesn't matter which half ) next to the TRRS Jack.
* Solder the sockets ( if using sockets ) or your blackpills at this point.
* Add the OLED / OLED sockets.
* Install the switches. 5 pin switches are recommended.
* Flash the firmware. Available at https://github.com/vattern/qmk_firmware/tree/keyboard/grandiceps , waiting on PR to merge
* Flash the other side :)
* Connect and sit back and enjoy.
